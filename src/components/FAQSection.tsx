        <AccordionContent className="p-4">
          Our smart contracts automate NFT transactions and manage key features
          like vault locking and yield distribution. This ensures secure,
          transparent, and trustless operations without manual intervention.

        <AccordionContent className="p-4">
          Vault locking is a process where you stake or lock your NFT in our
          secure contract. Once locked, your asset begins generating passive
          yield over time based on predefined smart contract algorithms.
